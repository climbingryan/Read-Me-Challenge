# ReadMe Generator

## Description
 Using node.js and the inquirer package I made an app that can create a REAME through a series of prompts and questions

## Usage
Download the zip or fork the repo to your local and go to the develop directory. From there type 'node index' or 'node index.js' to run the program. Once you've finished go to the "dist" folder and you'll find your README.md file.
